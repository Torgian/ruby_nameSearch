# ruby_nameSearch

Basic search function to look up names in a database and return their
birth dates. 

Asks for first name, but user can type in full name if wanted. 

User must type in name exactly, including capitals. 

If there are multiple entries, funciton will return those multiple names
and ask user which one he wants to inspect by typing in the last name.

This is far from complete, but is a decent base to start with.
